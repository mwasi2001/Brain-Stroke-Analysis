**Brain Stroke Risk Analysis**  

## **Overview**  
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset to uncover the critical factors contributing to brain stroke risk. By leveraging Python for data analysis and machine learning, we identified key insights that can support preventive healthcare and inform clinical decisions.  

---

## **Dataset**  
The dataset contains 4,981 records with 11 features, including:  
- **Age**: Age of the individual (continuous).  
- **Hypertension**: 1 if the patient has hypertension, else 0.  
- **Heart Disease**: 1 if the patient has heart disease, else 0.  
- **Average Glucose Level**: Measured in mg/dL.  
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index (continuous).  
- **Stroke**: 1 if the individual had a stroke, else 0.  

All data fields were clean with no missing values, ensuring smooth analysis.

---

## **Objectives**  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset’s structure and key trends.  
- Use **machine learning models** to identify the most significant factors contributing to stroke.  
- Visualize relationships and insights to make the results accessible and actionable.  

---

## **Tools and Techniques**  
### Libraries Used:  
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.  
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.  
- **Seaborn and Matplotlib**: For visualizations.  
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning.  

### Machine Learning Model:  
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Used to predict stroke occurrences and identify feature importance.  

---

## **Key Findings**  
1. **Age** is the most significant factor—older individuals are more prone to strokes.  
2. **Hypertension** is a major risk factor, highlighting the need for blood pressure management.  
3. **Glucose Levels**: High glucose levels, often linked to diabetes, strongly correlate with stroke risk.  
4. **BMI**: Obesity also contributes to stroke occurrence, reinforcing the importance of a healthy lifestyle.  

---

## **Project Workflow**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Inspected data for cleanliness.  
   - One-hot encoded categorical variables for machine learning compatibility.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:  
   - Analyzed distributions of key features using histograms and boxplots.  
   - Visualized relationships with correlation heatmaps.  

3. **Feature Importance Analysis**:  
   - Trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict stroke occurrences.  
   - Extracted feature importance scores and visualized them using bar plots.  

4. **Visualization**:  
   - Created clear, intuitive visualizations to present key findings.

## **Results and Impact**  
The analysis underscores the importance of:  
- Targeted preventive care for high-risk individuals (e.g., elderly or hypertensive patients).  
- Promoting healthy lifestyles to reduce BMI and glucose levels.  

The insights from this project can help healthcare providers prioritize care and reduce the prevalence of strokes.  

---

## **Future Work**  
- Expand the analysis using more advanced models like XGBoost or neural networks.  
- Integrate additional datasets to enhance the robustness of the findings.  
- Build a predictive dashboard for real-time stroke risk assessment.
